## Inspiration
With the virtual academic life of students, it's not easy to make friends and get to know more people that have the same interests as you.

## What It Does
This application aims to eliminate the barriers between students and make them easy to make friends. It will notify user by text message if that user enabled the notification settings and if there are any other users has three or more common interests within 500 meters radius. It will also let users chat with each other and show the locations on a map. It also includes events and campus resources for people to hangout


## How We Built It
We used Figma to design the frontend and vanilla JavaScript to connect it with the backend. We used Express, Node and MongoDB for the backend and used Twillio API to send the text message.

## Challenges We Ran into
We have an awesome frontend UI design using Figma, but it took us a lot of time to make and figure out how to convert that design to useable HTML and CSS files. 

## Accomplishments that We're Proud of
We are proud that we have completed the essential feature of the website, which is to send text messages to notify users that other users have common interests based on current latitude and longitude. And we have a fantastic frontend design, and it's responsive to the mobile browser.

## What We Learned
We learned a lot about Figma, and its related plugins. We also learned how to use Twilio API to send text messages

## What's Next for Happy Community
We are planning to change the website to a mobile application and finish implementing what is left for this product, which includes chatting with each other and render a map to show the users and resources.
